 iwconfig

 essid  Set the ESSID (or Network Name - in some products it may also be called Domain ID). The ESSID is used to identify cells which
              are part of the same virtual network.
              As  opposed  to the AP Address or NWID which define a single cell, the ESSID defines a group of cells connected via repeaters
              or infrastructure, where the user may roam transparently.
              With some cards, you may disable the ESSID checking (ESSID promiscuous) with off or any (and on to reenable it).
              If the ESSID of your network is one of the special keywords (off, on or any), you should use -- to escape it.
              Examples :
                   iwconfig eth0 essid any
                   iwconfig eth0 essid "My Network"
                   iwconfig eth0 essid -- "ANY"
