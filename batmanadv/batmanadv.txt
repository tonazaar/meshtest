1) Batman-adv for mesh setup
Batman-adv provides layer-2 connectivity. The references show various methods of using. 
A visualization tool is also provided to show mesh configuration

3) Notes
Both dhcpcd and wpa_supplicant services need to be stopped. This is needed, since these services manipulate the ad-hoc mesh network configurations that effectively breaks the network. An advanced setup should compromise with these services, but this tutorial will not cover such a setup. In addition I also disable hostapd just to be sure, but you may regressively try to enable above services with the necessary configurations after having a working base. Following snippet sets up a password-free ad-hoc connection on each node:

4) Basic mesh setup
https://github.com/suiluj/pi-adhoc-mqtt-cluster/wiki/Batman-Adv-and-Batctl

Create startup script
In your default user folder /home/pi create a file for the script: sudo nano batsetup-rpi.sh:

iw wlan0 set type ibss
ip link set wlan0 up

iw wlan0 ibss join <adhocnetworkname> 2432 key d:2:<password>
# replace <adhocnetworkname> with a ssid for example: rpiadhoc
# replace <password> with a password of length 5 or 13 (WEP) for example: abcdefghijklm

modprobe batman-adv
batctl if add wlan0

ip link set up dev wlan0
ip link set up dev bat0

batctl gw_mode client # optional if there is a gateway for internet in your network

sleep 10
alfred -i bat0 -m -p 1 &
sleep 10
batadv-vis -i bat0 -s &
