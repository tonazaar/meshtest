1) Babel 
Babel is a loop-avoiding distance-vector routing protocol roughly based on DSDV and AODV, 
but with provisions for link cost estimation and redistribution of routes from other routing protocols.
While it is optimised for wireless mesh networks, Babel will also work efficiently on wired networks.

3) Installation
sudo pacman -Sy babeld

4) You can participate in a Babel network by simply running
# babeld wlan0
where wlan0 is the name of your wireless interface.

In order to gateway between multiple interfaces, just list them all on the command line:
# babeld wlan0 eth0 sit1

On an access point, you'll probably want to redistribute some external routes into Babel:
# babeld \ 
-C 'redistribute metric 256' \ 
wlan0
or, if you want to constrain the routes that you redistribute,
# babeld \ 
-C 'redistribute proto 11 ip ::/0 le 64 metric 256' \ 
-C 'redistribute proto 11 ip 0.0.0.0/0 le 24 metric 256' \ 
wlan0
