Installation

sudo pacman -Sy babeld

You can participate in a Babel network by simply running
# babeld wlan0
where wlan0 is the name of your wireless interface.
In order to gateway between multiple interfaces, just list them all on the command line:
# babeld wlan0 eth0 sit1
On an access point, you'll probably want to redistribute some external routes into Babel:
# babeld \ 
-C 'redistribute metric 256' \ 
wlan0
or, if you want to constrain the routes that you redistribute,
# babeld \ 
-C 'redistribute proto 11 ip ::/0 le 64 metric 256' \ 
-C 'redistribute proto 11 ip 0.0.0.0/0 le 24 metric 256' \ 
wlan0
