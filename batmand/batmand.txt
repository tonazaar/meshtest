A) Basic test setup with batmand 
laptop(no internet) -> RSP(1) -> RSP(2) -> Internet
Mesh between RSP(1) - RSP(2)
Mesh between RSP(1) - RSP(2) - RSP(3)

C) Note
1) Both dhcpcd and wpa_supplicant services to be stopped. This is needed, since these services manipulate the ad-hoc mesh network configurations that effectively breaks the network. An advanced setup should compromise with these services, but this tutorial will not cover such a setup. In addition I also disable hostapd just to be sure, but you may regressively try to enable above services with the necessary configurations after having a working base. Following snippet sets up a password-free ad-hoc connection on each node:

2) In contrast to other routing protocols each batman node only knows the path to its single hop neighbors and knows nothing about the topology behind it. In practice it means that a batman node S is aware of node A which is somewhere in the mesh and reachable via neighbor B but it does not know about the number of hops and / or nodes in between.

D) Installation
sudo pacman -Sy batctl

E) Announcement
https://www.open-mesh.org/projects/batmand/wiki/AnnouncingNetworks

Adding the announcement for e.g. the local network:

batmand -c -a 192.168.1.0/24
Adding multiple announcements in one go:

batmand -c -a 192.168.1.0/24 -a 192.168.100.123/32
Revoking an announcement:

batmand -c -A 192.168.1.0/24
Revoking multiple announcements in one go:

batmand -c -A 192.168.1.0/24 -A 192.168.100.123/32

F) Batmand kernel setup
https://www.open-mesh.org/projects/batmand/wiki/Faq
What is the batgat kernel module good for?
The batman daemon maintains a tunnel connection to every "batman internet client". Every packet that goes to the internet or comes back has to go through this tunnel. As it is a user space tunnel a lot of copying between user space and kernel land is necessary. Depending on the number of clients and the CPU power available this might be a bottleneck.
The batgat kernel module tries to overcome this limitation.

EXAMPLES
       batmand eth1 wlan0:test
              Start batman daemon on interface "eth1" and on  alias  interface
              "wlan0:test"

       batmand -o 2000 -a 192.168.100.1/32 -a 10.0.0.0/24 eth1
              Start batman daemon on interface "eth1" with originator interval
              of 2000 ms while announcing 192.168.100.1 and 10.0.0.0/24.

       batmand -s 192.168.1.1 -d 1 eth1
              Start batman daemon on interface "eth1", sending topology infor-
              mation to 192.168.1.1 and with debug level 1 (does not fork into
              the background).

       batmand eth1 && batmand -c -d 1 -b
              Start batman daemon on interface "eth1". Connect in client  mode
              to get the debug level 1 output once (batch mode).

       batmand -g 2000kbit/500kbit eth1 && batmand -c -r 1
              Start  batman  daemon  on  interface "eth1" as internet gateway.
              Connect in client mode to disable the internet gateway  and  en-
              able internet search mode.


Work

1)  wget \
> https://downloads.open-mesh.org/batman/stable/sources/batman/batman-0.3.tar.gz


2) tar xzvf batman-0.3.tar.gz


3) make

4) cp batmand /usr/sbin/
cp: cannot create regular file '/usr/sbin/batmand': Permission denied
[alarm@alarmpi batman-0.3]$ sudo cp batmand /usr/sbin/
[sudo] password for alarm: 
[alarm@alarmpi batman-0.3]$ batmand eth0
Error - you must be root to run batmand !
[alarm@alarmpi batman-0.3]$ sudo batmand eth0
